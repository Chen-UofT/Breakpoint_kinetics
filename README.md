## Validation range
1. This simulator is based on the Unified Plus Model from the PhD thesis: Reactions Between Aqueous Chlorine and Ammonia: A Predictive Model, Xin Huang, Northeastern University, MA (2008)

2. The Unified Plus Model by Huang (2008) was calibrated and validated within the range: pH 6.5-9.5, temperature 4-30°C, total carbonate buffer 9×10⁻⁴ - 1×10⁻² M, initial Cl/N molar ratio 0.5-2.0

3. The validation range was extended to pH 5.5 with reaction time < 3 min and 60 min, temperature 4 and 20°C and Cl/N molar ratio 0.5–11. The validated parameters are applied to 5.0 < pH < 6.0 and 2 < T < 6 (for 4°C validation) 15 < T < 25°C (for 20°C validation) in this simulator.

4. The trichloramine concentration was not validated.
